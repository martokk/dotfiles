# Refrence Notes
# Cpu frequency (in kHz)
# example: for 800 MHz = 800000 kHz --> scaling_min_freq = 800000
# see conversion info: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/frequency/mhz-to-hz.html
# to use this feature, uncomment the following line and set the value accordingly

# Available Options:
# Available governors: conservative, ondemand, userspace, powersave, performance, schedutil  # - See available governors by running: cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
# Available turbo boost: always, auto, never
